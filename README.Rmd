The goal of Ripc is to provide access to [Integrated Food Security Phase
Classification](https://www.ipcinfo.org) (IPC) and
[Cadre Harmonis√©](https://www.ipcinfo.org/ch/) (CH) data. 

## Installation

You can install the Ripc from CRAN:

```r
install.packages("Ripc")
```

The development version can be installed from GitHub:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("OCHA-DAP/Ripc")
```

## Usage

Ripc provides functionality to access IPC data stored directly on the
[IPC-CH Public API](https://docs.api.ipcinfo.org). There are a wider set of
functions detailed further below, but most users will get the information they
need from the `ipc_get_population()` function which returns datasets of
country-level, group-level, and area-level analyses in a list.

```{r download, message = FALSE}
library(Ripc)

df_list <- ipc_get_population()
df_list$country
```

More details on the API are available below.
