\title{Get icons resources from the IPC API}
\usage{
ipc_get_icons(
  year = NULL,
  type = NULL,
  id = NULL,
  period = NULL,
  api_key = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{year}{Single numeric year to filter analysis, calculated from the
maximum year of current period dates. If \code{NULL}, the default, returns
data for all years.}

\item{type}{Single string value of 'A' or 'C', corresponding to food security
conditions, either acute or chronic. If \code{NULL}, the default, returns
data for all types.}

\item{id}{Analysis ID.}

\item{period}{Period code, either 'C', 'P', or 'A' for current, projection,
and second projection.}

\item{api_key}{IPC API key. If \code{NULL} (the default), looks for \code{IPC_API_KEY}
in the environment.}
}
\value{
A data frame.
}
\description{
Accesses the icons resources on the IPC API. Contains links from analysis and
area IDs to the icon resource the IPC uses in maps and publications. This
is likely \strong{not useful for the general user}. If \code{year} and/or \code{type}
parameters are passed, accesses the \strong{icons} public API endpoint, pulls in
data filtered to those parameters. To get all icons for a specific analysis
and period, available on the \strong{types/{id}/{period}} developer API endpoint,
pass in \code{id} and \code{period}. You cannot pass in both sets of parameters.
}
\details{
Icons data is used internally by the IPC to link up analyses for areas and a
relevant icon for display on maps and in publications. The icons are stored
in an Amazon S3 bucket that is not publicly accessible and therefore not
useful for general users. Provided here for convenience.

See the \href{https://www.ipcinfo.org}{IPC website} and
\href{https://docs.api.ipcinfo.org}{API documentation} for more information.
